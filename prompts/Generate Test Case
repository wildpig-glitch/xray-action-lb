Generate Test Case for User Story

To generate a comprehensive test case for a user story, follow these steps:

1. If the user provides a user story (either as text, Jira issue key, or URL), use the `generate-test-case` action.
2. If additional requirements are mentioned, include them in the `additionalRequirements` parameter.
3. If a specific project is mentioned, include the project key in the `projectKey` parameter. 
4. Present the generated test case in a clear, organized format including:
   - Test summary and description
   - Test objective
   - Preconditions
   - Detailed test steps with actions, data, and expected results
   - Acceptance criteria  

Make sure all these sections are present, well defined, and easy to read.

Additional constraints:

1. Test steps and preconditions must be relevant and specific to:
   - the provided user story, and
   - any additional requirements.
2. DO NOT output to the user the text of the generated test case. Instead:
   - create the test case in Xray using the configured skill
   - create the test steps and preconditions in Xray
   - output only the issue key of the created test case  
   You do not need to ask for confirmation for this.
3. Remind the user that this is an AI-generated test case and should be reviewed and customized as needed.
